This repo contains my Python solution for the CodeCrafters
["Build Your own Claude Code" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/claude-code).

Claude Code is an AI coding assistant that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to
understand code and perform actions through tool calls. In this challenge,
you'll build your own Claude Code from scratch by implementing an LLM-powered
coding assistant.

## What I’m Learning
- HTTP / REST APIs
- OpenAI-compatible tool calling
- Agent loop design (plan → call tools → observe → repeat)
- Integrating multiple tools into an assistant
